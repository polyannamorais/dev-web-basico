		<h2>LETRAS</h2>
		<p>
			Everybody's got their demons <br></br>
			Even wide awake or dreaming <br></br>
			I'm the one who ends up leaving <br></br>
			Make it okay <br></br>
			See a war I wanna fight it <br></br>
			See a match I wanna strike it <br></br>
			Every fire I've ignited <br></br>
			Faded to grey <br></br>
			But now that I'm broken <br></br>
			Now that you know it <br></br>
			Caught up in a moment <br></br>
			Can you see inside? <br></br>
			'Cause I've got a jet black heart <br></br>
			And there's a hurricane underneath it <br></br>
			Trying to keep us apart <br></br>
			I write with a poison pen <br></br>
			But these chemicals moving between us <br></br>
			Are the reason to start again <br></br>
			Now I'm holding on for dear life <br></br>
			There's no way that we could rewind <br></br>
			Maybe there's nothing after midnight <br></br>
			That could make you stay <br></br>
			But now that I'm broken <br></br>
			And now that you know it <br></br>
			Caught up in a moment <br></br>
			Can you see inside? <br></br>
			'Cause I've got a jet black heart <br></br>
			And there's a hurricane underneath it <br></br>
			Trying to keep us apart <br></br>
			I write with a poison pen <br></br>
			But these chemicals moving between us <br></br>
			Are the reason to start again <br></br>
			The blood in my veins <br></br>
			Is made up of mistakes <br></br>
			Let's forget who we are <br></br>
			And dive into the dark <br></br>
			As we burst into color <br></br>
			Returning to life <br></br>
			'Cause I've got a jet black heart <br></br>
			And there's a hurricane underneath it <br></br>
			Trying to keep us apart <br></br>
			I write with a poison pen <br></br>
			But these chemicals moving between us <br></br>
			Are the reason to start again <br></br>
			The blood in my veins <br></br>
			Is made up of mistakes <br></br>
			(To start again) <br></br>
			Let's forget who we are <br></br>
			And dive into the dark <br></br>
